This repository provides a Python-based tool and design assets for extracting the substrate dielectric constant (Œµ<sub>r</sub>)  and  loss tangent (tanŒ¥) from S-parameter measurements of a microstrip ring resonator.

## üì∫ Project Origin

This project was inspired by:
- [YouTube: "PCB Dielectric Constant Extraction with a Ring Resonator" by Gusberti Analog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Or-rcEIc7o&t=1090s)
- [Article: "Effective Dielectric Characterization for PCB Materials" by Gusberti Analog](https://gusbertianalog.com/effective-dielectric-characterization-for-pcb-materials/)

---

üì° **Purpose**: Characterize PCB materials (e.g., FR4, Rogers) using VNA measurements and resonator geometry.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure and Run the Script

Edit the parameters in the `substrate_permittivity_extraction.py` file under the CONFIG section:

```python
S2P_FILE       = "Measurements/10M_6G_no_soldermask.s2p"
RING_LENGTH_MM = 100.0
SUBSTRATE_H_MM = 1.5
TRACE_W_MM     = 3
```

Run the script:

```bash
python substrate_permittivity_extraction.py
```



### 3. Output

- Table of resonance modes and extracted permittivities
- Extracted loss tangent (tanŒ¥) for each resonance (printed and included in CSV)
- Plots (auto-saved):
